# Drug Recommendation Chatbot

## Overview

Welcome to the Drug Recommendation Chatbot project! This chatbot utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to analyze symptoms, detect diseases, and recommend drugs based on the identified diseases. Follow the steps below to set up and run the chatbot locally.

## Project Process

### 1. Dataset Collection

To train the ML model for disease detection, a comprehensive dataset of symptoms and corresponding diseases was collected. The dataset was sourced from reputable medical databases and resources, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

The collected dataset underwent preprocessing to clean and format the data. Text normalization, tokenization, and other NLP techniques were applied to prepare the dataset for model training.

### 3. Model Training

The ML model was trained on the preprocessed dataset using state-of-the-art algorithms. The training process, model architecture, and hyperparameter tuning details can be found in the `model_training` directory.

### 4. Integration with NLP

The trained model was integrated with NLP components to enhance the chatbot's ability to understand and interpret user-input symptoms. This step involved the use of natural language understanding techniques to improve the accuracy of disease detection.

### 5. Deployment

The final step involves deploying the chatbot for public use. The deployment process is documented to guide users on how to run the chatbot locally or access it through a hosted web service.
